# Random Flappy
�
�
 
## Basic Details 
### Team Name: chaithra ajith's team
### Project Description 
A chaotic twist on Flappy Bird where the control key (Up, Down, Left, Right) changes randomly every few seconds, making it hilariously impossible to master
### The Problem (that doesn't exist) 
Why play Flappy Bird with predictable controls when you can embrace pure chaos We’re solving the non-existent problem of overly stable game mechanics
### The Solution (that nobody asked for) 
A Python-based Flappy Bird game where the jump key swaps randomly, forcing players to adapt on the fly. Perfect for masochistic gamers and hackathon laughs!
